# MNIST-Example
A repo for producing a simple neural network example for a presentation, using MNIST

This repo has a Jupyter Notebook that uses the MNIST dataset to support a neural network example for a presentation that introduces Python to a largely unfamiliar audience. Some of the outputs and materials are included in the repo history. 

I wrote about using MNIST as a simple neural network example in https://benjackman.github.io/post/neural-network-demo-with-mnist-and-tensorflow/.
